PLEASE NOTE: this project is on my GitHub page for reference only as this app has then been rebuild, improved and expanded using SwiftUI, please see the SwiftLingo app.

AI Translate uses the DeepL Translator to translate text into 27 languages and the JoJ Text to Speech API to allow users to hear the pronounciation.
User authentication is handled through Firebase.

The DeepL Translator API request requires three parameters: "text", "source", and "target".

- Text: The text to be translated, provided by the user via a UITextView.
- Source and Target: These parameters specify the language of the original and translated text, respectively. They are set using two UIPickerViews. A switch statement maps each selected language to the corresponding language code specified in the API documentation.
 
The JoJ Text-to-Speech API generates a Base64 string, which is then decoded into binary data and saved in a temporary folder accessed by the audio player.

This API requires several parameters:

- Text: Matches the text generated by the translation.
- Voice: Three parameters within the "voice" dictionary, set by the Source PickerView. Additional switch statements map the selected language to the required API codes.
  
Firebase Firestore was chosen as the method to save user data, with the added benefit of making translations available across multiple devices.

Saving and Retrieval: Only registered users can save and retrieve translations.

SavedTranslationVC: Displays saved translations using a UITableView, which allows access to a detailed view showing the full translation, controls to listen to the pronunciation and to delete the translation.
