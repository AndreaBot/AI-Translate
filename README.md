AI Translate uses the DeepL Translator and JoJ Text to Speech APIs to translate text into 28 languages.

The DeepL Translator API request needs three parameters: "text", "source" and "target".

The "text" parameter refers to the text to be translated.
This is filled in by what the user types in a UITextView.
The initial version of the app used UITextFields but these have been replaced to allow the user to type multiline text instead.

The "source" and "target" parameters , referring respectively to the language of the original 
and final text, are filled in via two UIPickerViews.
As the API requires specific languages codes to be passed, a switch statement has been used to link each language to the code specified in the API documentation.

The JoJ Text to Speech API generates a Base64 string that gets decoded back into banary data and the resulting file is then saved in a temporary folder accessed by the audio player.

This API requires a few more parameters to be set:
- the "text" parameters matches the texts generated by the translation;
- the three parameters included in the "voice" dictionary are set by the Source PickerView (some additional switch statements set the required API codes based on the selected language).
